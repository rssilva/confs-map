# Confs-map

A simple site to add conferences geolocation (and other infos) and plot it to a map using Google Maps API.

## Contributing

For now the data is added on [confs.json](https://github.com/rssilva/confs-map/blob/gh-pages/confs.json) as something like the code below. Then committed to **gh-pages** branch.

```javascript
{
	"name": "Awwwards Conference",
	"city": "Amsterdam",
	"country": "Netherlands",
	"lat": 52.378800,
	"lng": 4.900451,
	"dates": ["27/01/2016", "28/01/2016", "29/01/2016"],
	"tags": ["design", "development", "ux"],
	"link": "http://conference.awwwards.com/amsterdam-2016/"
}
```
